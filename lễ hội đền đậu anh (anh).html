    <h2>THE TEMPLE DATES OVER 2200 YEARS</h2>
    <p>
        An ancient custom says that Cha Xa (present-day An Xa) is a swampy land, wild green forest, with many wild animals. One day, Heaven and Earth Fairy opened the gates of heaven to the earth, guiding good people to clear the wasteland and develop wet rice cultivation. Then, he was the one who had the merit of mobilizing the villagers to destroy wild animals and build "Thuy Ung Quan". At that time, this place was simply "thatched hut" on the land with the shape of a dragon's head, surrounded by a lake. Later, in the Ly dynasty (1010 - 1225), there was an old king who did not have a son to establish the crown prince, went to many places to pray and built many temples and pagodas. When the queen attended the festival and prayed at "Thuy Ung Quan" to gain self-esteem, the Empress Dowager consecrated it to build this place into a magnificent and majestic building. Since then, "Thuy Ung Quan" has become more and more known as a sacred place. Tourists from all over the world come to the temple to enjoy pure happiness (for wealth, for good fortune, for happiness...)

        Experiencing many ups and downs of history, Dau An Temple has been restored and embellished many times, but still retains its unique beauty from the very unique architecture of "Thuy Ung Quan".

        The cluster of relics is surrounded by big trees. Temples include: Thuong Temple (main temple), Council temple, Thanh Mau temple... The place to keep the most unique features is the Thuong temple, which is built in the shape of Dinh, including three small buildings: Tien Sa, Thuong. Electricity and the Palace. The sacrifice has five compartments made of precious wood. The Upper Palace was built by talented artisans, carved with precious stones with the dragon and phoenix pattern. Around the temple there are many historical relics. In front of the door of Thuong temple, there is a terracotta "Cuu Dung tower" (nine floors of ancient towers). The tower was built during the Ly - Tran dynasties. This is a tower with quite unique architecture and motifs. People believe that the nine-storey tower represents the nine high clouds of the fairyland, the way of "ascension and descent" of the Jade Emperor and the angels, the place of harmony between heaven and earth. . Khanh stone in Dau An temple is also considered a rare relic. Legend has it that, when Khanh was beaten, a large area of ​​the Northern Delta heard that they invited each other to go to Dau An festival.

    <h2>UNIQUE CULTURAL BEAUTY </h2>
    <p>
        Besides the above-mentioned rare and precious tangible cultural heritage, an invaluable intangible heritage has been kept in the hearts of every local resident and visitor, which is the Festival part.
        Dau An Festival is held from the 6th to 12th of April (lunar calendar). In which three days 6, 7 and 8 are the main festival.
        Day 6 is the opening day of the festival - the day people organize incense offerings to pay respects to Ngoc Hoang. The incense offering ceremony had the presence of Thien Tien, Dia Tien and Ngu Lao Tien.
        According to folklore, Thien Tien and Di Tien are two unusually large people, sent by the Jade Emperor to the lower world. In the earthly place, the two gave birth to many children and grandchildren, and then urgently established the village "Cha Xa". After that, he was also sent to the lower world to help Thien Tien and Di Tien to guide people to eradicate wild animals and develop wet rice cultivation. These three fairies are extremely respected and grateful by the people. These fairies are believed to be the first to establish Cha Xa and build "Thuy Ung Quan". Therefore, the palanquin worshiping the three gods is always carried to the Upper Temple to worship the Jade Emperor on the first festival day. Could this be seen as the recompense ceremony of Thien Tien, Dia Tien and Ngu Lao Tien and Ngoc Hoang Emperor?
        The next festival, the 7th, was also held very solemnly. The palanquins are carried around the village. The people who go to the procession are also very carefully selected. Those are healthy people with a clean background and lifestyle. The clothes these people are wearing are pink or black with a belt. In front of each palanquin is an old man knocking "command drums", dressed in a black shirt and turban. The most special palanquin is the Bat Cong lawsuit - carrying the Jade Emperor, going under the palanquin is the chief teacher (who looks after the Thuong temple) with the costume "above" with "closer" followed by "servant fan". When the Ngoc Hoang palanquin and the fairies were carried through, at the beginning of each alley, the villagers set up altars and offerings. The whole procession went on in a jubilant and solemn atmosphere. The sound of big drums, gongs, wards with bowl sounds, Buddha flags fluttering in the wind... All make us feel like we are "reviving" folk life. In the depths of the spiritual world, each person seems to have the words of his father from ancient times. Our souls seem to be sublimated, transcended and increased in a good direction.
        Day 8 is considered the biggest day of Dau An Festival. I don't know since when the witty folk song that "April 8th. Those who don't see the festival will lose their lives" was circulated. Just know that the 8th is the most jubilant festival of Hoi Dau An. This is the day people celebrate the most. Many lines of people eagerly approached the door of the "lobster's nest" - Dinh Vo village - to see the performance of the legend of fighting the tiger.
        An old story says that one morning the Jade Emperor was on his way to Cha Xa when he heard that there was a fierce tiger in the west of the village. The Jade Emperor issued a decree for Monsignor Lo Quoc Dinh Vo to settle. Monsignor sent Tien Bong Do Nguyen Suy and two athletes riding pink horses to fight tigers. After a long time fighting with the tiger, still unable to decide, the tiger ran into the nest to hide. Tien Bong Do Nguyen Su sent two athletes to spread the news to the people and ask talented people for help. Just then, Mrs. Kho's mother and daughter were on their way to beggar, and she hurriedly walked to Monsignor and worshiped Ngoc Hoang to ask for permission to follow Tien Bong to eradicate evil tigers. The petition is accepted. Mrs. Hard took the pole and struck three times, shaking the whole lobster's nest, rocking the ground, hitting her while saying: "Where are you going, let me make it difficult for you to fight with the lobster?" Immediately, the tiger panicked and ran out of the nest, was beaten by Mrs. Kho and Tien Bong Do Nguyen Su and two athletes with nine sticks to the head, the tiger died and was skinned, beheaded, and returned to the communal house. This death shows the martial spirit of the people along with the deep belief that the power of the village community can overcome natural disasters and drive out evil beasts.
        Chasing wild animals out of the village is the sacred aspiration of the good people. This makes them believe that the crops will be bountiful, the village's daughters will be beautiful, the villagers will live happily...
        This belief has been and is being handed down among the people. So far, the branches and leaves decorated on the roof of the lobster's nest are still considered sacred objects. Many people who go to festivals when watching "beating tigers" try to win a little bit of si leaf with the belief that si leaf will bring happiness to themselves and their loved ones.
        Dau An Temple is a unique architectural complex imbued with national culture. Dau An Festival is a big festival, attracting thousands of participants on a grand scale. The festival has bold features of folklore in general and the beauty of wet rice culture in the North in particular. It expresses people's burning desire for a peaceful, prosperous and happy life...
